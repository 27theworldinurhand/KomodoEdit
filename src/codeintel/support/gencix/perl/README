Steps to generate CIX files from Perl:

1. Download ActivePerl for the Perl version to create a CIX for.
2. Open genperlcix.py, search for "ActivePerl", and update the path to where
   you unpacked ActivePerl (no need to install it).
3. Also edit the last line to be the version of Perl you are creating a CIX for.
4. Open ../../../lib/codeintel2/manager.py and search for the "buf_from_path"
   function. On around the 4th line, comment out the "raise CodeIntelError"
   for a file being too big. (ActivePerl has at least one big file.)
5. Run `python genperlcix.py`
6. Revert your change to manager.py in step #4.
